This is an algorithm for composites having interface plasticity using discrete element method.
Shear stress strain curve is used for interface properties and interface act as a nonlinear spring.
Tablets act as a node.

Reference for the methodology for this code is "Discrete-element modeling of nacre-like materials: Effects of random microstructures on strain localization and mechanical performance", by Najmul Abid, Mohammad Mirkhalaf, Francois Barthelat.
